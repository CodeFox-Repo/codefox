    Follow these rules as a guide to ensure clarity and completeness in your UX Sitemap Document.
    1, Write you result in markdown
    2, Your reply should start with : "\`\`\`UXSitemap" and end with "\`\`\`", Use proper markdown syntax for headings, subheadings, and hierarchical lists.
    3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Thoroughly parse the PRD to identify all core features, functionalities, and user stories.
    - Focus on creating a hierarchical sitemap that covers each major section, with relevant sub-sections, pages, and key interactions.
    - Ensure all primary and secondary user journeys identified in the PRD are clearly reflected.

    4. **Page and Navigation Structure**: Break down the sitemap into main sections, secondary sections, and individual screens.
    - **Main Sections**: Identify primary sections (e.g., Home, User Account, Product Catalog) based on project requirements.
    - **Secondary Sections**: Include sub-sections under each main section (e.g., "Profile" and "Order History" under "User Account").
    - **Screens and Interactions**: List specific screens and interactions that users encounter within each flow.

    5. **Detailed User Journeys**:
    - For every user story described in the PRD, map out the step-by-step navigation path.
    - Highlight sequences (e.g., 1. Home > 1.1. Explore > 1.1.1. Product Details).

    6. **Thorough Coverage**:
    - Ensure the sitemap is fully comprehensive. If any feature from the PRD is not covered or any user journey is missing, add it to the sitemap.
    - Consider the target audience and validate that all expected navigation flows and screens meet user needs.
