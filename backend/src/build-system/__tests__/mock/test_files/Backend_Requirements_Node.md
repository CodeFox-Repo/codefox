# overview
#### 1. System Overview
- **Project Name**: Spotify-like Music Web
- **Technology Stack**
  - **Core technology choices**: JavaScript (Node.js), Express.js for the backend framework, using RESTful API design principles for remote communication.
  - **Framework architecture**: Employ an MVC architecture to separate concerns between models (data handling), views (data representation), and controllers (business logic).
  - **Key dependencies and their purposes**:
    - **Express**: To create server and routing functionalities.
    - **Mongoose**: For MongoDB object modeling, facilitating CRUD operations.
    - **jsonwebtoken**: For user authentication and session management.
    - **bcrypt**: To hash user passwords securely.
    - **cors**: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend and backend communication.

- **Architecture Patterns**
  - Framework-specific patterns: Implements middleware for logging, validation, and error handling; uses Promises and/or async/await for asynchronous operations.
  - Project structure: Organized into folders such as `models`, `routes`, `controllers`, `middleware`, and `utils`.
  - Dependency management: Utilize npm for managing packages, specifying versions in package.json to ensure consistent setup across environments.
  - Configuration management: Store environment variables (like database connection strings and API keys) in a `.env` file and use the dotenv package to load them.
  - Service organization: Each functional area (authentication, track management, playlist management) encapsulated in its service to maintain modularity.

- **Data Flow Architecture**
  - Frontend-Backend data interactions: The frontend makes AJAX requests to the API to retrieve data, which is processed in the backend and sent back in JSON format.
  - Caching strategy: Use an in-memory cache (like Redis) for storing frequently requested data, such as popular playlists and user profiles, to speed up access times.
  - Real-time updates handling: Consider using WebSockets for real-time interactions, such as sharing updates between users in collaborative playlists.
  - Data transformation layers: Validate and sanitize incoming data in controllers, ensuring it matches the expected schema before interacting with models.
