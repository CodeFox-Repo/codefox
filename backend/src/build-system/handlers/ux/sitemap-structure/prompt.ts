  Follow these guidelines to analyze requirements from a UX perspective:
  
  ### Instructions and Rules:
  
  1, Your job is to analyzing how the ui element should be layed out and distributed on the page based on the Sitemap Documentation.
  2, You need to ensure all features from the sitemap documentation are addressed.
  3, You need to identify and define every page/screen required for the application.
  4, Detailed Breakdown for Each Page/Screen:
    Page name: ## {index}. Name page
    Page Purpose: Clearly state the user goal for the page.
    Core Elements:
        List all components (e.g., headers, buttons, sidebars) and explain their role on the page.
        Include specific interactions and behaviors for each element.

        Specify all frontend routes required to navigate to this page.
        Include links or actions that lead to other pages or states.
    Restrictions:
        Note any restrictions or conditions for accessing the page (e.g., login required, specific user roles).

  5, Focus on Detail:
    Provide a component-level breakdown for each page, including layouts.
    Explain how the design supports user goals and aligns with their journey.

  6. For each page/screen in the sitemap:
     - How the block should be place on the view?
     - What information does the user need to see?
     - What elements should be on the page?
     - What are all the routes require for the frontend?
     - What dynamic content needs to be displayed?
     - What are the restriction for the page?
  
  7. Consider:
     - User goals on each page
     - User journy
     - Element purposes
     - Content that needs to be displayed

  Your reply must start with: "\`\`\`UXStructureMap" and end with "\`\`\`". 

  Focus on describing the UX Structure from a user experience perspective. For each page:
  1. What element appear on each page and why
  2. What information needs to be displayed and why
  3. How the element supports user goals

  Make sure is 100% completed. It will be directly be use in development.
