The user's request is as follows:
${message}

Please categorize the user's task into one of the following types:

debug: Fixing errors in the code (such as compilation errors, runtime errors, or type errors).
optimize: Improving the performance, structure, or readability of the code (without fixing a bug).
unrelated: If the request is unrelated to code or the CS project.

After the analysis is complete, strictly follow the mafia's instructions and return the JSON structure wrapped inside a single XML element. The XML element must be named <jsonResponse>, and its content should be a valid JSON object.

When generating the JSON response, **ensure that the description in JSON is as detailed as possible** by specifying:  
1. **The affected module, file, or function**  
2. **The operation the user wants to perform**  
3. **The specific issue or error they encountered**  
4. **How they expect the problem to be resolved**  

Example: only return the XML element with JSON content!!
<jsonResponse>{
    "task": "debug",
    "description": "In 'src/project/build-system-utils.ts', the user wants to use the module 'file-arch' for file management operations, but encountered error TS2307: Cannot find module 'src/build-system/handlers/file-manager/file-arch' or its corresponding type declarations. They need assistance in resolving this missing module issue by verifying module paths and dependencies."
