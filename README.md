# ü§ñHow It Works

This project supports **structured task orchestration** where tasks (nodes) are executed in a sequence or in parallel, depending on the configuration. The execution process is handled by several key components:

- **BuilderContext**: Manages the global state, execution context, and node data.
- **BuildSequenceExecutor**: Drives the overall execution flow, managing steps and nodes.
- **BuildHandler**: Executes individual tasks (nodes) and stores results.
- **HandlerManager**: Provides specific handlers for nodes.
- **ModelProvider**: Integrates external services like LLM API calls.

### **Sequence Diagram (Simplified Version)**
